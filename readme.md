I found a copy of Badur Ramji `scream.ca` which was titled AfterMichaelMandiberg at the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

Here's a link to that:

Their [faq](https://archive.org/about/faqs.php#28) clearly states this:

> Can people download sites from the Wayback?
> Our terms of use specify that users of the Wayback Machine are not to copy data from the collection.
